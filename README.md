# disaster-code-fundo

Taking examples from the recent floods in Kerala and North East, I have seen that the entire disaster management system of India is pretty chaotic. There is no central system through which the volunteer organisations, government agencies, military forces collaborate so that the people can benefit maximum from them. All the relief funds operate at suboptimal levels because there is no information about the current scenario to the paramedics or volunteers.

I plan to devise a system which will help the victims, volunteers and government agencies collaborate with one another. I plan to implement this system using a mobile application as in the present world that is the best way to reach out to one another.
The app will contain basic emergency contact information of that district/town/village. It will also contain a small and highly specialized map(via google Maps or any similar API) of that area. This will be available as offline download. Such information should be available without internet as in times of calamity, there usually isn't much network available. I agree that electricity is also usually not there but I think implementing something via the mobile device is much more easy than installing embedded system. 

After a user signs in the app, he needs to choose that he is a victim/volunteer/government employee etc. Different types of users will have different dashboard.

(These listed below will need some internet connection to be of any use).

User Dashboard(Features) - GPS Locations of the places which are safest as of now and danger zones(Decided by government).
                           Current activity zones of relief funds and Volunteer organizations so that they can orient         themselves in that direction.
                           Expected weather conditions for the next 24 hours and latest news updates concerning the calamity.
                           Conditions of roads and public routes which are safe to take.
                           Mark themselves as unsafe on the map so that they can be found by rescue forces.

Government Dashboard(Features) - Assign the places which are safe for people to come to and which are dangerous.
                                 Current activity zones of relief funds and Volunteer organizations.
                                 Current status of various people who have marked themselves as unsafe.
                                 Give directions to the volunteers to target areas with major issues first and communicate with volunteer organizations so that they can be put to the best use.
